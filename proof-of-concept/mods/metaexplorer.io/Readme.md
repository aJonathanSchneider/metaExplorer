# Metaexplorer.io - Mod
This mod is the experimental ground for the continued development of metaexplorer.io. Once a utility here has proven useful, it might be moved to other mods, or its own mod.

## currently testing
- @metaexplorer/wpgraphql-to-linkeddata  getting blog posts from wordpress and wrapping them in a linked-data format with types from schema.org. Generate and display a Material-Design card with that data
