# Installation

- run `yarn bootsrap`
- run `yarn build`

# running with the development server

- run `yarn start`

the development server saves your blocks under "packages/editor-dev-server/dev-srv-nocode/blocks"
you can load a stylesheet depending on the username of your main interpreter. This would be located under "WEB_ROOT/styles/username-style.css", or if you're using the editor-dev-server, put it under "packages/editor-dev-server/dev-srv-nocode/styles/username-style.css"
