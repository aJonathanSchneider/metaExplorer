## usage candidates
flow : type inference while coding
yarn : does what npm did before, just supposedly better
rxjs: reactive programming, enables observables (better async handling through streams)
redux: state management (synchronously), patterns here are actions and reducers
redux-observable: redux + rxjs (asynchronously), central pattern here are epics
URI.js: used for URI templating. I found it quite late, could be used more
pdfjs: display pdf files with javascript
tesseractjs: ocr with js: https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js#tesseractjs
vega: declarative data visualization. https://github.com/vega/vega  &  https://github.com/vega/editor  as an editor

redux-devtools: makes debugging the application state changes easily
extractsass: the css/scss-plugins put the styles inline, this plugin will extract in when in production mode
