## usage candidates
flow : type inference while coding
yarn : does what npm did before, just supposedly better
rxjs: reactive programming, enables observables (better async handling through streams)
redux: state management (synchronously), patterns here are actions and reducers
redux-observable: redux + rxjs (asynchronously), central pattern here are epics

redux-devtools: makes debugging the application state changes easily
extractsass: the css/scss-plugins put the styles inline, this plugin will extract in when in production mode
